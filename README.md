# Predicting-The-Value-of-CO2-Emission
This is my first Data Science Project. The purpose of this project is to predict the value of CO2 emission by using Simple Linear Regression algorithm. Special thanks to Dr. Mohammed Al-Obaydee for the guidance.

## Business Understanding

Case Study: To find the value of CO2 emission from cars.

* Goal: To predict the value of CO2 emission based on single independent variable.
* Objective: To build a predictive model using Simple Linear Regression algorithm.

*Single Independent Variable means it stands alone and cannot be changed.*
*Simple Linear Regression algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm to model linear relationship between to variables.*
